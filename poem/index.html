<p class="title"><b>Even Without Words, He Speaks - By Elizabeth Madox Roberts.</b></p>
											 
		 		<p>His bridle hung around the post.<br>
				The sun and the leaves made spots come down;<br>
				I looked close at him through the fence;<br>
		 		The post was drab and he was brown.</p>
	
				<p>His nose was long and hard and still,<br>
				And on his lip were specks like chalk.<br>
				But once he opened up his eyes,<br>
				And he began to talk.</p>
	
				<p>He didn’t talk out with his mouth;<br>
				He didn’t talk with words or noise.<br>
				The talk was there along his nose;<br>
				It seemed and then it was.</p>
			
				<p>He said the day was hot and slow,<br>
				And he said he didn’t like the flies;<br>
				They made him have to shake his skin,<br>
				And they got drowned in his eyes.</p>
			
				<p>He said that drab was just about<br>
				The same as brown, but he was not<br>
				A post, he said, to hold a fence.<br>
				“I’m horse,” he said, “that’s what!”</p>
			
				<p>And then he shut his eyes again.<br>
				As still as they had been before.<br>
				He said for me to run along<br>
				And not to bother him any more.</p>
